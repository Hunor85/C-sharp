# Integer literals

Integer literals can be decimal without any prefix. For example:
```c#
var decimalLiteral = 42; 
```
If the literal has no suffix, its type is the first of the following types in which its value can be represented: int, uint, long, ulong.
The following table shows the types in which different literal values can be represented:
